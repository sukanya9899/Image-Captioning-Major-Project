  "About": {
    "paragraph": "Image captioning system is the process of extracting features and generating meaningful insights automatically from an image in the form of natural sentence. The system uses the collaboration of computer vision and natural language processing to accomplish the task. In this project, we proposed architecture for multi-modal image captioning system using VLAD encoded CNN and LSTM. In our approach, we used multiple VLAD encoding method with the CNNs features for image classification. In particular, the power of VLAD in this multi-modal architecture leads our proposed model to yield better performance compared to the existing methods.",
